<p>Back in the late 80's I walked into the Ritz in the middle of the Laughing Hyenas and watched in disbelief while singer John Brannon churned out one hell of a gutteral yowl for the duration of a whole set in almost inhuman fashion. The Hyenas channelled extreme rage through total Stooge/primal Alice Cooper mode with a somewhat bluesy Birthday Party swagger, and eventually I learned he fronted Detroit's hardcore godfathers <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/negativeapproach"">Negative Approach</a> in the early part of that decade. Later it all came into focus: NA were very much first-wave and represented Detroit as one of the pockets dotted around the USA (see Black Flag, Minor Threat, Bad Brains), with Brannon &amp; company consolidating the midwest brotherhood with the Necros and Meatmen and eventually moving into early singles via Corey Rusk's Touch and Go label (originally a zine, where yes, people learned of the underground way before the internet). As far as first-wave HC goes, Negative Approach were among the most vicious feedback-pummel units going. Songs careened by in seconds, were pretty much politics-free, focusing on sheer vocal/instrumental destruction. They were inspired by not only their American peers, but UK groundbreakers like Discharge (who, like, NA, were big Stooges fans). In 2006 they returned to the stage at the Touch and Go label anniversary, with Brannon and original drummer Chris Moore augmented by Ron Sakowski on bass and Harold Richardson on guitar, reportedly wiped the place down. On the day of their recent Southpaw show, they amazingly agreed in a day's notice to come down to <a href=""http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/BT"">my show on FMU</a>, plugged in and turned us to mush with 16 songs in 25 minutes.</p>

As far as first-wave HC goes, Negative Approach were among the most vicious feedback-pummel units going. Songs careened by in seconds, were pretty much politics-free, focusing on sheer vocal/instrumental destruction. They were inspired by not only their American peers, but UK groundbreakers like Discharge (who, like, NA, were big Stooges fans). In 2006 they returned to the stage at the Touch and Go label anniversary, with Brannon and original drummer Chris Moore augmented by Ron Sakowski on bass and Harold Richardson on guitar, reportedly wiped the place down. On the day of their recent Southpaw show, they amazingly agreed in a day's notice to come down to <a href=""http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/BT"">my show on FMU</a>, plugged in and turned us to mush with 16 songs in 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Negative Approach live on WFMU 5/14/08 (broadcast 5/27). Host: Brian Turner, engineer: Richard Rusinkovich (edited-for-FCC version appeared over air). Co-interviewer: Tony Rettman. Ken Freedman shot video of ""Hypocrite"" and ""Dead Stop"".</p>
<p>Set list: Lost Cause / Can't Tell No One / Sick of Talk / Hypocrite / Dead Stop / Whatever I Do / Tied Down / Evacuate / Your Mistake / Why Be Something That You're Not / Pressure / Fair Warning / Nothing / Borstal Breakout (Sham 69) / Never Surrender (Blitz) /Solitary Confinement.</p>

Born in Athens, GA in the early 1990's, they issued a slew of records that should have been recognized much more than they were; their non-peggability probably hurt their public/press profile, not to mention the neo-Barrett psychedelia that was emerging from their hometown overshadowing them somewhat in the scheme of collegiate radio.

I finally saw them for the first time a few years ago at Tonic opening for Khanate, and it remains one of my favorite live show memories. They sucked the oxygen out of the air for minutes at a time; extended passages of silence give way to crushing, Melvinsy swaths of pure majestic overload; singer/guitarist Creston issued forth gutteral vocals like he was fronting Lynard Skynard slowed down to 16 RPM. Muzzy chords would just loom ominously over the room for what seemed like an eternity and then they'd crack open into propulsive Thin Lizzy mode and change bizarre time signatures on a dime and sounded just fantastic.

But now, having the band show up and kick off the proceedings at Spiro's first on the bill (sorry about the club's drink ticketkeeper being AWOL, Stephen!) was a total freakin' dream come true.

Of all of them, I now like this version the best. Oh well, no going back‚Ä¶</p>

lyrics
You never know just how long you have 
Before you go 
Away 

So take back life; hide it from view 
It will only be us and 
the wind 

Times are down but we‚Äôre ok 
Lines are down but we‚Äôre ok 
We‚Äôre ok. 

You never know just how many times 
You get to say 
Hello 

Come out with me take the f-train 
Into the night 
We‚Äôll disappear 

Times are down but we‚Äôre ok 
Lines are down but we‚Äôre ok 
We‚Äôre ok. 

When you send light into the world 
It scatters and reflects 
But it never dies",2302,,Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States,1557,,3,,[],ok,1
